Palm OS software development repo

Additional info on my palm development ventures...
During the years of looking for information in palm devices I found a lot of interesting on the internet,
at some point I tried to summarize it all on this website I created, but I have not added anything new for ages...

the website itself https://handheldbreadcrumbs.github.io/ . hope you find something interesting there
